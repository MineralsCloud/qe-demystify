# qe-demystify

I am tired of `Quantum ESPRESSO`'s unclear [description](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/resources/users-manual/input-data-description) about its’ input/output files, so I decided to write some of it myself. Usually this is done by reading its source code.

You are very welcome to contribute!
